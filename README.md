# Suika Game Clone with Physics

We are a group of students collaborating to create a clone of the Suika Game with physics using Java. We also introduced various customized features and effects including: bomb, freeze, rainbow, gates, level design (planned). This project is intended for our submission for the class CS 3360 - Dr Dung.
